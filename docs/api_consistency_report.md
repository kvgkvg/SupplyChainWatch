# Frontend / Backend API Consistency

## Summary

The backend API paths exposed in `backend/app/api/routes` and the frontend API client in
`frontend/src/api/client.ts` now agree on paths, query parameters, and TypeScript response
types.

## Endpoint Coverage

| Frontend client method | Backend endpoint | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `health()` | `GET /api/health` | Matched |
| `indices()` | `GET /api/indices` | Matched |
| `indexHistory(name, params)` | `GET /api/indices/{name}` | Matched |
| `indexForecast(name)` | `GET /api/indices/{name}/forecast` | Matched |
| `vesselSnapshot(params)` | `GET /api/vessels/snapshot` | Matched |
| `vesselDetail(mmsi)` | `GET /api/vessels/{mmsi}` | Matched |
| `ports(region?)` | `GET /api/ports` | Matched |
| `portCongestion()` | `GET /api/ports/congestion` | Matched |
| `portTimeline(portId, days)` | `GET /api/ports/{id}/timeline` | Matched |
| `chokepoints()` | `GET /api/chokepoints` | Matched |
| `chokepointTimeline(id, days)` | `GET /api/chokepoints/{id}/timeline` | Matched |
| `anomalies(params)` | `GET /api/anomalies` | Matched |
| `latestInsights(limit)` | `GET /api/insights/latest` | Matched |
| `storyAnalyze(body)` | `POST /api/story/analyze` | Matched |
| `correlations(indices, days)` | `GET /api/correlations` | Matched |
| `overviewStats()` | `GET /api/stats/overview` | Matched |

## Remaining Integration Gaps

- Some pages still keep local mock/generated data as a demo fallback when the API is empty or
  unavailable. Dashboard and Insights Hub now prefer live API data where available.
- The Macro page displays `SCFI`, but the backend collectors currently produce `BDI`,
  `FBX_GLOBAL`, `WCI_GLOBAL`, weather route indicators, and FRED proxy series. Either add an
  SCFI source on the backend or remove/hide SCFI until data exists.
- The Vessel Map page expects enriched fields such as destination, ETA, string vessel type,
  and DWT in the main map dataset. The backend snapshot endpoint currently returns AIS fields
  plus optional vessel metadata: `mmsi`, `lat`, `lon`, `sog`, `cog`, `nav_status`, `name`,
  numeric `type`, `type_label`, and `flag`.
- The Ports page expects congestion level, anomaly flag, wait time, sparkline, and vessel-type
  breakdown. Backend responses provide reference ports, current congestion counts, and timelines;
  those view-model fields need to be derived in the frontend or exposed via a richer backend
  endpoint.
- The Insights page maps backend `narrative_llm || narrative`, `category`, and timestamps into
  feed rows and displays an AI-generated badge when LLM text is present.
- Dashboard KPI labels are compatible with backend `overviewStats`, but trend sparklines and
  market snapshot rows still need to be assembled from `/indices`, `/ports/congestion`,
  `/anomalies`, and `/insights/latest`.
