# GlobalSupplyWatch Architecture

## Overview

GlobalSupplyWatch is a local Docker Compose application for monitoring global shipping and supply-chain conditions. The system combines scheduled data collection, time-series storage, spatial analysis, anomaly detection, forecasts, and AI-assisted insight narratives.

## Runtime Containers

| Service | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `postgres` | TimescaleDB/PostGIS database for time-series and spatial data. |
| `redis` | API cache, Celery broker, and result backend. |
| `backend` | FastAPI REST API. |
| `worker` | Celery worker for collectors, analysis jobs, and LLM enrichment. |
| `beat` | Celery beat schedule runner. |
| `flower` | Celery monitoring UI. |

## Data Flow

1. Collectors validate source records with Pydantic schemas.
2. Validated records are persisted to TimescaleDB/PostGIS tables.
3. Analysis jobs compute port congestion, chokepoint risk, anomalies, forecasts, correlations, and template insights.
4. The LLM enrichment layer calls DashScope through the OpenAI-compatible API.
5. Safety guards reject generated text that contains unauthorized numbers.
6. FastAPI exposes typed JSON endpoints for the frontend.
7. The frontend renders live data when available and falls back to mock/demo data when the backend is empty.

## Main Tables

| Table | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `vessel_positions` | AIS vessel positions, indexed spatially. |
| `freight_indices` | BDI/FBX/WCI/FRED-style index values. |
| `port_congestion` | Computed vessel counts around ports. |
| `chokepoint_status` | Computed vessel count and risk score per chokepoint. |
| `anomalies` | Rolling z-score anomaly records plus optional LLM explanation. |
| `forecasts` | Forecast horizon, metrics, and optional LLM commentary. |
| `insights` | Template narratives plus optional LLM narrative enrichment. |
| `llm_usage_log` | Model, token, latency, status, and error logging for cost monitoring. |

## API Surface

The frontend uses the following groups:

- Health: `/api/health`
- Indices and forecasts: `/api/indices`, `/api/indices/{name}`, `/api/indices/{name}/forecast`
- Vessels: `/api/vessels/snapshot`, `/api/vessels/{mmsi}`
- Ports: `/api/ports`, `/api/ports/congestion`, `/api/ports/{id}/timeline`
- Chokepoints: `/api/chokepoints`, `/api/chokepoints/{id}/timeline`
- Insights: `/api/anomalies`, `/api/insights/latest`, `/api/correlations`
- Story Mode: `POST /api/story/analyze`
- Overview: `/api/stats/overview`

## LLM Layer

The LLM layer is optional and controlled by `.env`:

- `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`
- `LLM_ENABLED`
- `LLM_MODEL_FAST`
- `LLM_MODEL_FAST_FALLBACKS`
- `LLM_MODEL_REASONING`
- `LLM_MODEL_REASONING_FALLBACKS`

All LLM calls go through `app.llm.client.LLMClient`, which provides retry, token-limit model fallback, circuit breaking, timeout handling, and usage logging.

## Performance Notes

- Vessel queries use bounding boxes and spatial indexes.
- Heavy API responses are Redis-cacheable.
- The Vessel Map page is lazy-loaded in the frontend bundle.
- Map rendering uses level-of-detail assumptions suitable for thousands of points.
